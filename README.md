## Prerequisites

To use this website the following is what you'll have to do.

* Clone this repository, or download it into your local machine.
* Double click the `index.html` file to open using the web browser.

And. There is one more even easier way to access it. Just click on [this link.](https://herrin-fragrance.netlify.app/)

## Why this ?

This website was created because of one frustrated [Ben Stewart](https://sbenstewart.in/) who was asked by his relatives to share the songs of his sister. Many methods were used, like CDs, thumb drives and even the dumb old Google Drive paired with Gmail. YouTube was not considered because why not. All of these methods quite didn't work well. So this music streaming server has been hosted.

## How this ?

The frustrated Ben Stewart being a bit familiar with HTML, just played around with the same to implement it.

The tech stuff used are as follows:

1. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/herrin-fragrance) to act as the CDN.
2. [html5media](https://html5media.info/) for audio player capabilities.
3. [plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) because why not.
4. [jquery](https://jquery.com/) as Ben Stewart is lazy enough.
5. [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) because not everyone uses a 2560 x 1600 display.
